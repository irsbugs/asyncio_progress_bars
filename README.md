# Asyncio Progress Bars

## Simultaneous Progress Bar Incrementation

The following code cells demonstrate the use of Asyncio to have two tasks performing the incrementing of two Progress Bars in the Jupyter Notebook environment.

The first code cell printouts the elapsed time and the value of each task.

The second code cell combines the first cells asyncio logic with the ipywidgets IntProgress and FloatProgress.

The third code cell is the asyncio logic and the progress bars without the verbose comments. When the code is running the progress bars look like this:

The error message: `AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'create_task'` is display when the code is run with a version of python that is less than 3.7. The asyncio's *create_task* method was added in Python 3.7. One option is to build a python 3.7 virtual environment as follows:

```
$ sudo apt install python3.7 python3-venv python3.7-venv
$ python3.7 -m venv py37-venv
$ . py37-venv/bin/activate
(py37-venv) $ pip install jupyter
```
